    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 tablespoons of sugar</li>
        <li>1 can of sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>1 can of milk (use the same measure as the condensed milk)</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a 20-centimeter diameter pudding mold, place 6 tablespoons of sugar and heat over medium heat until it turns into a caramel syrup (approximately 3 minutes).</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and rotate the mold so that the caramel coats the entire bottom and sides. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a blender, combine the sweetened condensed milk, whole milk, and eggs. Blend well for about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Turn off the blender and let the mixture rest for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>During this resting time, the foam will rise to the surface, resulting in a smooth pudding without holes.</li>
        <li>Gently remove the foam from the surface using a spoon, and carefully pour the blender mixture into the reserved caramel-coated mold.</li>
        <li>Bake in a water bath at 180°C (350°F) for about 1.5 hours.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven, let it cool, and refrigerate for approximately two hours. Unmold and serve.</li>
    </ol>
